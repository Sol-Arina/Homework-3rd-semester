An Empirical Test of the Agglutination
Hypothesis1

Martin Haspelmath




Abstract In this paper, I approach the agglutination-fusion distinction from an
empirical point of view. Although the well-known morphological typology of
languages (isolating, agglutinating, flexive/fusional, incorporating) has often been
criticized as empty, the old idea that there are (predominantly) agglutinating and
(predominantly) fusional languages in fact makes two implicit predictions. First,
agglutination/fusion is characteristic of whole languages rather than individual con-
structions; second, the various components of agglutination/fusion correlate with
each other. The (unstated, but widely assumed) Agglutination Hypothesis can thus
be formulated as follows:

 (i) First prediction: If a language is agglutinating/fusional in one area of its mor-
     phology (e.g. in nouns, or in the future tense), it shows the same type elsewhere.
(ii) Second prediction: If a language is agglutinating/fusional with respect to one
     of the three agglutination parameters (a-c) (and perhaps others), it shows the
     same type with respect to the other two parameters: (a) separation/cumulation,
     (b) morpheme invariance/morpheme variability, (c) affix uniformity/affix sup-
     pletion.

    I report on a study of the nominal and verbal inflectional morphology of a
reasonably balanced world-wide sample of 30 languages, applying a variety of
measures for the agglutination parameters and determining whether they are cross-
linguistically significant. The results do not confirm the validity of the Agglutination
Hypothesis, and the current evidence suggests that "agglutination" is just one way
of trying to capture the strangeness of non-Indo-European languages, which all look
alike to Eurocentric eyes.

1 Agglutination and fusion: An Ambiguous Success Story
One of the seemigly most successful stories in the history of linguistic typology is
the creation of a holistic morphological typology in the first half of the 19th century,
initially by the combined efforts of Friedrich von Schlegel (1808), August Wilhelm
von Schlegel (1818), and Wilhelm von Humboldt (1822, 1836). As is widely known
(e.g. Greenberg 1974: 35-41), these three were responsible for the classical subdi-
vision of languages into an isolating (or "analytic") type, an agglutinating type,
a fusional (or flexive) type,2 and an incorporating type. This way of classifying
languages was made popular especially by Schleicher (1850) and Müller (1871), and
has been part of linguists' textbook knowledge ever since. Almost every introduction
to linguistics mentions the terms, and they are frequently used in the technical liter-
ature (at least the term agglutinating/agglutination). Three representative sentences
from recent works by influential authors are given in (1).
(1) a. Evans (1995: 1): "Kayardild is a dependent-marking, agglutinating, entirely
       suffixing language with a free order of phrasal constituents and a rich system
       of case-marking. . ."
    b. Slobin (1997: 281): ". . . On this account, agglutinating languages like Turk-
       ish and Japanese have no closed-class morphemes. . ."
    c. Hyman (2001: 1397): ". . . In other words, a highly developed paradigmatic
       system of tonal oppositions appears not to be very compatible with a highly
       developed syntagmatic system of agglutinative morphology"
   But at least since Sapir (1921), it has been widely recognized that this four-way
distinction is problematic, because it conflates three different parameters: (i) the
degree of synthesis (isolating vs. non-isolating, or in other terms, analytic vs. syn-
thetic); (ii) the degree of stem combination (incorporating vs. non-incorporating);
and (iii) the degree of fusion (agglutinating vs. fusional/flexive). The notions of
synthesis and stem combination are quite easy to describe and identify, as long as
one agrees on word boundaries and a definition of "stem". But what exactly is meant
by agglutination and fusion/flexion, and what we need such concepts for, cannot be
so readily explained.



2 For the flexive type, other term variants such as (in)flexional/inflectional are also often used. As
was often noted (e.g. Bazell 1958), the term inflectional is confusing because it also has a different
sense: One also says that agglutinating languages have inflection (i.e. different word-forms belong-
ing to a single lexeme), so Sapir's term fusional has tended to supplant it in the typological sense.
Plank (1999) retains the term flexive (deliberately differentiating it from inflectional), presumably
because he feels that there is much more to the agglutination/flexion distinction than what Sapir
meant by fusion (cf. note 7). In this paper, I use fusion as the opposite of agglutination, simply
because it seems that this term is now better known.
An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                    15

   So with respect to the agglutination/fusion distinction, the success of the 19th
century classification is ambiguous: While the classification is still widely known,
it does not have an exact meaning and does not seem to be taken seriously. In
fact, with a few notable exceptions (Skalička 1951/1979, Plank 1986, 1991, 1999,
Plungian 2001, Testelets 2001), linguistic theorists in the latter half of the 20th
century have either ignored or severely criticized 19th century morphological typol-
ogy. The quotations in (2) seem to be fairly characteristic of the mainstream view.
(2) a. Anderson (1985: 10): ". . . nothing much seems to follow from this classifica-
       tion: it has never been shown, for example, that languages with agglutinative
       properties share other features of a non-accidental sort that are not shared
       with non-agglutinating languages as well. For these reasons, the traditional
       terms do not seem to constitute any significant typology."
    b. Bauer (1988: 170): "Basically, a typology is not of much value unless it pre-
       dicts other things about the various types of languages. . . Now . . . a typology
       in terms of isolating, agglutinative and fusional does not [seem to] correlate
       with anything else in the morphology at all. . . The value of the typology qua
       typology is thus very much in doubt."
    c. Spencer (1991: 38) "This typology, though sanctioned by tradition, has been
       criticized for being both incoherent and useless. It is useless because nothing
       of any interest follows from classifying languages in this way."
But if classical morphological typology is "incoherent and useless", why is the ter-
minology still with us? Moreover, most linguists find that the parameters of degree
of synthesis (e.g. Greenberg 1954[1960], Bickel & Nichols 2005) and incorporation
(e.g. Baker 1996) are of great typological interest. Is there also an "agglutination
parameter"? In the following section I will argue that the agglutination/fusion dis-
tinction is much more interesting than superficial textbook statements such as in
(2a-c) make it appear, but we will eventually see that an empirical test largely comes
to negative conclusions about ist validity.


2 The Agglutination Hypothesis: Implicit Claims Made Explicit

Anderson, Bauer and Spencer make seriously misleading statements when they
claim that nothing of interest follows from classifying languages into agglutinating
and fusional types, and that it implies no correlations. The use of this classification
does imply testable claims about extremely interesting correlations, but these claims
are usually not made explicit.
    The reason why the classification implies a number of correlations is that "ag-
glutinating language" is not a primitive notion. As we will see shortly, saying
that a language or a pattern is agglutinating embodies a set of logically separate
claims. By accepting the classification of languages or patterns into agglutinating
and non-agglutinating types, one implicitly accepts the idea that the various proper-
ties that make a language agglutinating correlate with each other. Thus, we should
think of agglutination not so much as a classificatory concept or as a parameter
16                                                                                  M. Haspelmath

of variation, but as an empirically testable hypothesis. I call it the Agglutination
Hypothesis here, and I distinguish two main components of it. (This is very similar
to Plank's (1999:285) "Strong Homogeneity Hypothesis".3 )
    The first empirical claim (or universal prediction) follows from the fact that what
is normally classified as agglutinating or fusional is whole languages, not just small
subsystems. So implicit in this classification is the expectation that the First Predic-
tion in (3) is correct.
(3) First Prediction: Correlation among parts of the morphology
    If a language is agglutinating/fusional in one area of its morphology (e.g. in
    nouns, or in the future tense), it tends to show the same type elsewhere.
Logically speaking, languages could of course be agglutinating in their noun mor-
phology and fusional in their verb morphology, or even isolating in the indicative
mood and agglutinating in the subjunctive mood. But linguists tend to accept the no-
tion that the morphological types apply to entire languages, thus implicitly claiming
that languages are more homogeneous than they would have to be. This presup-
position of course goes back to the early 19th century, and it could be that it is
simply naive. In the early days of modern typology, what struck linguists was the
differences between languages, and not so much the more abstract differences be-
tween patterns. In other areas of typology, linguists also tended to ascribe interesting
differences to languages in the past (e.g. "ergative languages", "tone languages"),
whereas more recently they have usually become more careful, recognizing that
system splits (such as ergative in the perfective vs. accusative in the imperfective)
are not a marginal phenomenon. Dividing languages into accusative, ergative and
neutral languages is a meaningful enterprise only if one expects that different con-
structions tend to show the same patterns, or at least that one of the constructions is
somehow predominant.
    The second empirical claim follows from the fact that agglutination is not a prim-
itive feature. But what exactly are the component features of agglutination? Unfor-
tunately, it is very difficult to find a precise definition of agglutination and fusion in
the literature. A few exemplary definitions are listed in (4) (emphasis is mine).
(4) a. Bloomfield (1933: 207): "Inflectional languages show a merging of seman-
       tically distinct features either in a single bound form or in closely united
       bound forms, as when the suffix -ō in a Latin form like am ō 'I love' ex-
       presses the meanings 1st, sg, pres, ind."
    b. Hjelmslev (1963[1968:109]): ". . . flektierenden Typ, bei dem die Grenze
       zwischen Wurzel und Suffix nicht klar ist, bei dem jedes Suffix oftmals
       gleichzeitig mehrere verschiedene grammatische Verhältnisse ausdrückt, und



3 The only reason I do not adopt Plank's term is that my term "Agglutination Hypothesis" appears
in the title of this paper, and I did not want the paper to be unrecognizable. Note that I developed
these ideas independently of Plank (but under the influence of his earlier work, e.g. Plank 1986,
1991), at about the same time.
An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                                   17

        bei dem die Wurzel selbst bei der Flexion Veränderungen erfahren
        kann."4
     c. Anderson (1985: 9): "(in)flectional languages have internally complex words
        which cannot easily be segmented into an exhaustive and non-overlapping
        string of formatives"
     d. Vance (1987: 175): "[In agglutinative languages] each morph represents
        only one semantic unit. . . The other property is that morphs are simply
        stuck together ("agglutinated"); ideally, the boundaries between morphs
        are clear, and there is no allomorphy."
     e. Whaley (1997: 134): "A language is fusional if the boundaries between its
        morphemes are hard to determine. The effect is as if the morphemes were
        blending, or fusing, together."
    Most modern authors seem to agree that one of the ingredients of fusion is cu-
mulation, i.e. the expression of several morphological subcategories in one affix (cf.
the quotations from Bloomfield, Hjelmslev and Vance).5 Agglutinating structures,
by contrast, exhibit separation (to use a terminology that was introduced by Frans
Plank, cf. Plank 1986, 1999).
    Another characteristic of fusional languages is that they exhibit stem alterna-
tions, i.e. the (co-)expression of morphological categories by changing, rather than
adding to, the stem (cf. Hjelmslev's definition). This is actually the oldest criterion:
Friedrich von Schlegel and his 19th century followers were primarily struck by the
difference between, on the one hand, languages like Sanskrit and German with their
salient stem vowel changes, and on the other hand, languages like Quechua, which
exhibit complete stem invariance.
    A very vague criterion that is often mentioned in definitions of fusion and aggluti-
nation is that segmentation of morphemes is "difficult" (cf. Hjelmslev's, Anderson's
and Whaley's definitions). The question of course is what properties of the language
cause these difficulties. It seems that they often arise from stem alternations (see
the last paragraph) or from affix alternations. The basic idea is that in a typical
agglutinating language, each affix not only stands for just one subcategory, but is
also invariant in its shape, whereas in fusional languages, not only stems, but also
affixes show considerable morphophonological allomorphy.6 Consider the partial
paradigm of Hungarian noun inflection in (5).



4 "the inflectional type, in which the boundary between root and suffix is not clear, in which each
suffix often expresses several different grammatical properties simultaneously, and in which the
root can undergo changes even in inflection."
5 Note that I use the term subcategory for concepts such as singular, dative, future, and category-
system for concepts like number, case, tense. (Plank 1999 uses the terms term/category in the same
sense.)
6 Greenberg (1954[1960:185]) uses morphophonological alternations of stems and affixes as the
decisive criterion for his "index of agglutination", i.e. he disregards cumulation, and he lumps stem
alternations and affix alternations together. (In this he is followed by other linguists working in the
tradition of quantitative typology, such as Krupa 1965 and Silnitsky 1993.)

                         Acc        házakat       asztalokat       folyókat
It is not immediately obvious how these forms should be segmented. For example,
in the accusative singular form házat, the accusative suffix could be taken as -at, or
as -t (as in asztal-t and folyó-t). In either case, we have to recognize an alternation, a
stem alternation (ház/háza) or an affix alternation (t/at). Thus, it is the existance of
alternations that makes segmentation difficult, and affix invariance makes it easy.
    An even more radical kind of lack of one-to-one correspondence between mean-
ing and form is affix suppletion, which is also commonly associated with fusional
as opposed to agglutinating morphology (see especially Skalička 1951). Affix sup-
pletion is allomorphy that cannot be described in phonological or morphophonolog-
ical terms. It can be conditioned lexically, as in (6a); morphologically, as in (6b); or
phonologically, as in (6c). Lack of affix suppletion will be called affix uniformity.

   It appears that cumulation, stem alternation, affix alternation, and affix sup-
pletion are the key ingredients of non-agglutination or fusion. In the following,
I will assume (somewhat counterfactually7 ) that no other morphological properties
are relevant to defining the agglutination/fusion distinction.

7 In a few works that address the agglutination/fusion distinction in some detail (Skalička 1951,
Pöchtrager et al. 1998, Plank 1999, Plungian 2001), a number of further correlating properties have
been mentioned:
   agglutinating                 fusional
   affixes distinct              affixes often homonymous
   always zero exponence         no/sporadic zero exponence
   only local exponence          also extended exponence
   repeatable affixes            unrepeatable affixes
   large paradigm size           small paradigm size (cf. Plank 1986)
   loose bonding                 tight bonding
   optionality                   obligatoriness
Thus, the number of claimed correlations that can be found in the literature is actually much higher.
However, since these correlations are little known, one would not say that using the terms "agglu-
tination" and "fusion" implies accepting these correlations as valid. Thus, testing these further
correlations is less urgent than testing the correlations that are implicit in the definitions of "agglu-
tination" and "fusion", and I will not say anything further about them here.
An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                                  19

   From the perspective of the individual properties, one could simply describe
a language as cumulating, or as stem-alternating, or as affix-uniform, and so on.
However, the fact that languages (or patterns) are typically described as "agglu-
tinating" or as "fusional" shows that linguists expect the component properties
to correlate with each other. So the Agglutination Hypothesis makes a second
prediction:

(7) Second Prediction: Correlation among different component properties
    If a language is agglutinating/fusional with respect to one of the component
    properties (cumulation, (stem/affix) alternation, affix suppletion), it will to be-
    have similarly with respect to the other features.
   Taken together, the two predictions made by the Agglutination Hypothesis are of
course extremely interesting for the comparative linguist. But whether the terms "ag-
glutination" and "fusion" are really useful depends also on whether the hypothesis is
true. Somewhat surprisingly, this question has rarely been asked (Plank 1999, which
came to my attention only after the first version of this paper had been finished, is
the only exception known to me).
   Apparently, it has not been generally recognized that the terms "agglutination"
and "fusion" imply strong empirical claims, so linguists have not attempted to test
these empirical claims. Another reason why such a test has not been carried out is
probably that it encounters multiple difficulties, some of which will be addressed
in the next section. However, I will also say how they can be overcome, so that in
Section 4 I will present a first empirical test of the correlations.



3 Difficulties for an Empirical Test

If one wants to compare the morphological systems of widely different languages,
one needs to make a large number of simplifications and idealizations, hoping that
these do not introduce a bias into the investigation. In this section I discuss some of
the difficulties I encountered in testing the two predictions of the preceding section,
and make proposals for how to overcome them.
    First, different languages show different morphological categories and vary sig-
nificantly in morphological complexity. This is a difficulty especially for testing the
First Prediction. For example, if this prediction is taken to imply that agglutinaton
in nouns entails agglutination in verbs, it is impossible to test in languages that have
inflectional morphology in verbs but not in nouns.8 To address this difficulty, I only
looked at languages with a fair amount of inflection, and took into account only
the core of nominal and verbal inflection. Thus, I left aside inflection of adjectives,
adpositions and other word classes (which are difficult to compare across languages


8   Such languages could of course be taken to exhibit isolation in nouns, though this is rarely done.
20                                                                         M. Haspelmath

anyway). I also left aside non-finite verb morphology, which does not belong to the
core of verbal inflection and differs more across languages than tense, aspect and
voice morphology. The assumption behind this is that if the idea at the heart of the
Agglutination Hypothesis is correct, the correlations should emerge even if only the
core inflectional categories of nouns and verbs are considered.
   Second, it is well-known that cumulation is extremely common everywhere
with person-number affixes (cf. Cysouw 2003: 296). Some examples of possessive
person-number affixes in languages from different continents are given in (8):

           Europe)             North             Guinea)           Africa)

   2       kez-etek            'em-kakkio        te-neme           pàl` -wú
                                                                       e

           'my hand etc.'      'my legs etc.'    'my head etc.'    'my knife etc.'
Thus, including person-number affixes would lead us to find some amount of cu-
mulation in the great majority of languages, even in languages that otherwise would
probably be regarded as perfect examples of the agglutinating type. Thus, in my
empirical test, I counted "person-number(-gender)" as a single inflectional category-
system, so that these cases do not count as cumulation.
    Third, in tense-aspect-mood forms, cumulation also seems to be common, but it
is extremely difficult to identify the categories that are cumulated and to distinguish
cumulation from semantic complexity. Consider the examples in (9).

(9)                         past + perfective   past + imperfective

In Modern Greek, one can readily isolate a perfective marker −s and a past marker
é-. Both forms are fully compositional. In Lezgian (Haspelmath 1993), it is pos-
sible to identify an imperfective marker -zwa and a past marker − j, but the past
perfective -na is not compositional. In Italian and Pipil (a Uto-Aztecan language
of El Salvador), we have no compositionality at all. We might say that both Ital-
ian and Pipil are fully cumulative, but it is not even fully clear that "past" and
"(im)perfective" are separate inflectional categories in these languages. To avoid
these complications, I regarded "tense-aspect-mood" as a single category-system,
unless there were very strong reasons to separate them.

   Fourth, a problem with measuring the relevance of stem alternations is that
in most languages, only a subset of lexical items show stem alternations (e.g. in
German, only strong verbs alternate, and these are a small minority), and gener-
ally most lexical items do not alternate. We would probably want to quantify the
importance of stem alternation: A language that has a stem change in one lexical
item should not be regarded as equally fusional (with regard to the criterion of stem
alternation) as a language that has stem changes in more than a hundred items. Thus,
for each category-system separately, I assigned scores depending on the (estimated)
absolute number of lexemes that exhibit stem alternations:
   score of 1       fewer than 10 lexemes with stem alternation
   score of 4       10-50 lexemes
   score of 7       more than 50 lexemes
   score of 10 the majority of (or all) lexemes
   Fifth, morphophonological affix alternations are very difficult to distinguish from
purely phonologically conditioned alternations. For example, the German plural
suffix -n/-en (as in Straße-n 'streets', Frau-en 'women' Partikel-n 'particles') could
either be described as morphophonological affix alternations (making German fu-
sional in this regard), or as the same affix that happens to have different realizations
for purely phonological reasons. After considering this problem thoroughly, I de-
cided to exclude the property "affix alternation" from the empirical test, because it
did not seem feasible to make the distinction in a coherent way for a greater number
of languages.9


4 The Empirical Test

4.1 Data
Thus, in my empirical test of the two predictions I studied three properties of
morphological systems: cumulation, stem alternation, and affix suppletion. I ex-
amined a sample of thirty languages which is somewhat biased in the usual way,
with more languages from Europe than would be justified by the genealogical di-
versity in Europe. Not all the languages are unrelated, but each is from a differ-
ent genus (in the sense of Dryer 2005). The thirty sample languages are listed in
Table 1.
   For each of these thirty languages, I determined a Cumulation Index, an Alter-
nation Index, and a Suppletion Index, separately for nominal and for verbal inflec-
tion. The value of these indices is always between 0 (maximal agglutination) and
100 (maximal fusion). The Cumulation Index is defined as the percentage of in-
flected forms that exhibit cumulation; the Alternation Index is defined as the average

9 I also simplified the procedure by considering only up to fifteen subcategories per lexeme class,
and only up to ten subcategories per category-system, on the assumption that more was not required
to capture the type of the language.

category-system divided by the number of category-systems; and the Suppletion
Index is defined as the average percentage of subcategories (per category-system)
that exhibit affix suppletion.



4.2 Testing the Second Prediction: Correlation Among
    the Three Indices?

Let us begin by examining the Second Prediction: is there a correlation among the
three indices? Do languages with a lot of stem changes also show a lot of cumula-
tion, and do languages with a lot of cumulation also show a lot of affix suppletion?
The values of the three indices for the sample languages are shown in Table 2, where
the languages are listed in rank order.
    Comparison between the three indices is made difficult by the fact that the num-
bers stand for very different things. The total range of the values is not very different:
between 0 and 66 for Cumulation, between 0 and 75 for Alternation, and between
0 and 84 for Suppletion. Thus, no language shows 100% fusion with respect to
any of the indices, and for each index, there is at least one language with 100%
agglutination. However, it is easily seen that the Cumulation values tend to be much
lower than the Alternation and Suppletion values. Cumulation is simply a rare phe-
nomenon outside of the Indo-European family, if cumulation of person and number
is disregarded and if tense and aspect are not counted separately (see the discussion
in Section 3). Only the Indo-European languages Hindi-Urdu and Latin have figures
over 20% of cumulative forms.

   Now the crucial question is: Do the languages tend to exhibit similar values for
each of the three indices?10 This is difficult to see by just inspecting Table 2, so in
order to make the indices more comparable, I compared the rank values on the three
indices. Table 3 lists languages in the order of average rank. The first three columns
give the three indices, but the most important triple of figures is the rank values in

10 That the different components of agglutination do not always go together has occasionally been
noted in the literature. Thus, Vance (1987: 176) notes for Japanese:
   "Japanese morphology certainly tends to be agglutinative. The two properties involved in
   agglutination, however, do not correlate very well. Portmanteau morphs are rare. . . Allo-
   morphy, on the other hand, is not at all uncommon. . ."
24                                                                                 M. Haspelmath

the next three columns. These figures show, for example, that Tauya has rank 14 for
Cumulation, rank 4 for Alternation, and rank 2 for Suppletion, and so on. By the
criterion of average rank, Tauya turns out to be the "most agglutinating" language,
while Kannada is the "least agglutinating" language, and Indo-European languages
such as Latin and German are also close to the bottom. This accords well with
our expectations, of course, but there are also some surprises, especially perhaps
the low (and hence "relatively fusional") position of Hungarian and Finnish. These
languages have traditionally been labelled "agglutinating" (in Table 3, all languages
which have been called "agglutinating" in the literature are preceded by an asterisk).
    Of course, the confirmation of our expectations for Turkish and Latin does
not mean that the Agglutination Hypothesis has been confirmed. On the contrary,
it could well be that the models of these two well-known languages have been
so powerful that linguists have unconsciously tended to define agglutinating as

"Turkish-like" and fusional as "Latin-like".11 In this way, various properties that
happen to be combined in these languages would have become part of the typolog-
ical prototype, although there is in fact no tendency for these features to cooccur in
languages cross-linguistically.
   As can be seen from Table 3, there are some "well-behaved" languages that show
similar rankings with respect to the three indices, e.g. Maricopa (ranks 13, 14, 12),
Ossetic (ranks 21, 21, 24.5), Arabic (ranks 23, 25, 27), and Kannada (ranks 25,
26, 24.5). If all languages were like these, we would say that the three indices
really cluster with each other, and that the Second Prediction of the Agglutinaton
Hypothesis has been confirmed.
   But unfortunately, too many languages are not "well-behaved". For example,
Nivkh has the ranks 22, 4, 1, Páez has the ranks 28, 4, 5, Ponapean has the ranks
5.5, 30, 3, and Hindi-Urdu has the ranks 29, 4, 23. In fact, there is no statistically
significant correlation among the three rankings: the Kendall coefficient of concor-
dance is W = 0.37, X2 = 32.19, and the significance is p < .35, well above the
significance level of .05. My empirical test thus provides no support for the Second
Prediction of the Agglutination Hypothesis.
   This does not mean, of course, that I have definitively disconfirmed this predic-
tion. My assignment of the various indices has involved some simplifications and
arbitrary choices that could have influenced the results in a negative way. But my
results present a strong challenge to those linguists who still want to maintain the
agglutination-fusion distinction.


4.3 Testing the First Prediction: Correlation Among Nominal
    and Verbal Inflection?

But what about the First Prediction, concerning the correlation between different
parts of the morphology? Since it is well-known that verbs and nouns sometimes be-
have differently (e.g. the Romance and Balkan Slavic languages lost their nomonal
case inflection, but retained the synthetic verb inflection of their ancestors), one
might not have particularly high expectations with regard to this prediction. Already
Greenberg (1954[1960: 182]) noted that "a term like agglutinative applies primarily
to a single construction. A language may well and indeed usually does contain some
agglutinational as well as some nonagglutinational constructions." And Wolfgang
U. Dressler, a consistent proponent of the agglutination-inflection typology along
Skalicka's lines (cf. Dressler 1985, Pöchtrager et al. 1998), has recently acknowl-
edged that "noun inflection and verb inflection may have a different typological
character within the same language and develop diachronically in typologically
different directions" (Dressler 2005: 7). Thus, it is not exactly expected that the
First Prediction would fare better in my empirical test.


11 A quotation such as the following is quite typical: "The ideal type of an agglutinating language,
best represented in Turkish. . ." (Pöchtrager et al. 1998: 57).

   To test it, I looked at nouns and verbs separately, for all three indices. Table 4
shows the index values and rank numbers, separately for the three indices.
   We see that for Alternation and especially Suppletion, the rankings do corre-
late significantly (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, p < 0.01 (Suppletion),
p < 0.05 (Alternation)). However, for Cumulation there is no significant correlation
(p < 0.20).
   Thus, we can say that languages tend to show (or lack) affix suppletion and stem
alternations in both nouns and verbs simultaneously. In other words, languages
can be meaningfully typologized as generally affix-suppleting (vs. affix-invariant)
languages, and as generally stem-alternating (vs. stem-uniform) languages, at least
across nouns and verbs. Thus, it is not completely meaningless to search for the
kinds of correlations that we have been looking at here. But these positive correla-
tions are hardly sufficient to justify a global distinction between "agglutinating" and

"fusional" languages, because as we saw in the preceding section, affix suppletion
and stem alternation do not correlate among each other.


5 Conclusions
The overall results of this study are mostly negative. The main positive point is that
it is indeed possible, if difficult, to test the Agglutination Hypothesis empirically.
    But the result of the preliminary empirical test carried out here is mostly negative.
I have not found a statistically significant correlation between the Cumulation index,
the Alternation index and the Suppletion index, which would have been expected
if the correlations implicit in the composite types "agglutinating" and "fusional"
existed.
    Also, the evidence that nouns and verbs tend to behave alike is not overwhelming.
There is no correlation with respect to cumulation, which is sometimes taken to be
the primary defining property of "fusional" languages (especially in the more recent
literature), and also for alternation, the evidence for a correlation is not particularly
strong. However, with respect to affix suppletion, we can say that nouns and verbs
tend to behave in the same way across languages.
    Since the study is based on a relatively small number of languages and the sample
is not truly representative of the diversity of the world's languages, these results are
far from conclusive. I cannot say that I have shown that the Agglutination Hypothe-
sis is wrong. However, the results cast sufficient doubt on the hypothesis to say that
from now on, the burden of proof is on those who believe that it is correct.
    As there are indications that stem alternation and affix suppletion characterize
both nouns and verbs, one can legitimately characterize entire languages as affix-
suppleting or stem-alternating. However, since cumulation does not tend to be sim-
ilar across word classes, it is less meaningful to characterize entire languages as
"cumulating" or "separatist". These terms are meaningful primarily when applied
to particular morphological subsystems.
    After this study, the terms agglutination and fusion have lost much of their legit-
imacy (unless they are given a technical sense that is at variance with the common
usage). Of course, it is logically possible to define a composite type consisting of
properties that do not correlate with each other (or only very partially), but it does
not make much sense. While Turkish could perhaps still be characterized as "agglu-
tinating" and Latin as "fusional", for many languages neither of these terms would
apply, and it would not be possible to say that they are "intermediate" between
these two extremes either. It is quite possible that the reason for the success of the
agglutination/fusion distinction is that Latin and Turkish have been such promi-
nent languages in Western linguistics over the last few hundred years. They differ
strikingly in their morphological systems (cf. Plank 1991), and it is perhaps natural
that from this point of view one would classify languages as more Latin-like or
more Turkish-like. However, linguistics should move beyond Lationocentrism and
Turkocentrism and try to do justice to each language, to describe and characterize it
in its own terms, or in truly universal terms.

Abstract In this paper, I approach the agglutination-fusion distinction from an
empirical point of view. Although the well-known morphological typology of
languages (isolating, agglutinating, flexive/fusional, incorporating) has often been
criticized as empty, the old idea that there are (predominantly) agglutinating and
(predominantly) fusional languages in fact makes two implicit predictions. First,
agglutination/fusion is characteristic of whole languages rather than individual con-
structions; second, the various components of agglutination/fusion correlate with
each other. The (unstated, but widely assumed) Agglutination Hypothesis can thus
be formulated as follows:

 (i) First prediction: If a language is agglutinating/fusional in one area of its mor-
     phology (e.g. in nouns, or in the future tense), it shows the same type elsewhere.
(ii) Second prediction: If a language is agglutinating/fusional with respect to one
     of the three agglutination parameters (a-c) (and perhaps others), it shows the
     same type with respect to the other two parameters: (a) separation/cumulation,
     (b) morpheme invariance/morpheme variability, (c) affix uniformity/affix sup-
     pletion.

    I report on a study of the nominal and verbal inflectional morphology of a
reasonably balanced world-wide sample of 30 languages, applying a variety of
measures for the agglutination parameters and determining whether they are cross-
linguistically significant. The results do not confirm the validity of the Agglutination
Hypothesis, and the current evidence suggests that "agglutination" is just one way
of trying to capture the strangeness of non-Indo-European languages, which all look
alike to Eurocentric eyes.

1 Agglutination and fusion: An Ambiguous Success Story
One of the seemigly most successful stories in the history of linguistic typology is
the creation of a holistic morphological typology in the first half of the 19th century,
initially by the combined efforts of Friedrich von Schlegel (1808), August Wilhelm
von Schlegel (1818), and Wilhelm von Humboldt (1822, 1836). As is widely known
(e.g. Greenberg 1974: 35-41), these three were responsible for the classical subdi-
vision of languages into an isolating (or "analytic") type, an agglutinating type,
a fusional (or flexive) type,2 and an incorporating type. This way of classifying
languages was made popular especially by Schleicher (1850) and Müller (1871), and
has been part of linguists' textbook knowledge ever since. Almost every introduction
to linguistics mentions the terms, and they are frequently used in the technical liter-
ature (at least the term agglutinating/agglutination). Three representative sentences
from recent works by influential authors are given in (1).
(1) a. Evans (1995: 1): "Kayardild is a dependent-marking, agglutinating, entirely
       suffixing language with a free order of phrasal constituents and a rich system
       of case-marking. . ."
    b. Slobin (1997: 281): ". . . On this account, agglutinating languages like Turk-
       ish and Japanese have no closed-class morphemes. . ."
    c. Hyman (2001: 1397): ". . . In other words, a highly developed paradigmatic
       system of tonal oppositions appears not to be very compatible with a highly
       developed syntagmatic system of agglutinative morphology"
   But at least since Sapir (1921), it has been widely recognized that this four-way
distinction is problematic, because it conflates three different parameters: (i) the
degree of synthesis (isolating vs. non-isolating, or in other terms, analytic vs. syn-
thetic); (ii) the degree of stem combination (incorporating vs. non-incorporating);
and (iii) the degree of fusion (agglutinating vs. fusional/flexive). The notions of
synthesis and stem combination are quite easy to describe and identify, as long as
one agrees on word boundaries and a definition of "stem". But what exactly is meant
by agglutination and fusion/flexion, and what we need such concepts for, cannot be
so readily explained.



2 For the flexive type, other term variants such as (in)flexional/inflectional are also often used. As
was often noted (e.g. Bazell 1958), the term inflectional is confusing because it also has a different
sense: One also says that agglutinating languages have inflection (i.e. different word-forms belong-
ing to a single lexeme), so Sapir's term fusional has tended to supplant it in the typological sense.
Plank (1999) retains the term flexive (deliberately differentiating it from inflectional), presumably
because he feels that there is much more to the agglutination/flexion distinction than what Sapir
meant by fusion (cf. note 7). In this paper, I use fusion as the opposite of agglutination, simply
because it seems that this term is now better known.
An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                    15

   So with respect to the agglutination/fusion distinction, the success of the 19th
century classification is ambiguous: While the classification is still widely known,
it does not have an exact meaning and does not seem to be taken seriously. In
fact, with a few notable exceptions (Skalička 1951/1979, Plank 1986, 1991, 1999,
Plungian 2001, Testelets 2001), linguistic theorists in the latter half of the 20th
century have either ignored or severely criticized 19th century morphological typol-
ogy. The quotations in (2) seem to be fairly characteristic of the mainstream view.
(2) a. Anderson (1985: 10): ". . . nothing much seems to follow from this classifica-
       tion: it has never been shown, for example, that languages with agglutinative
       properties share other features of a non-accidental sort that are not shared
       with non-agglutinating languages as well. For these reasons, the traditional
       terms do not seem to constitute any significant typology."
    b. Bauer (1988: 170): "Basically, a typology is not of much value unless it pre-
       dicts other things about the various types of languages. . . Now . . . a typology
       in terms of isolating, agglutinative and fusional does not [seem to] correlate
       with anything else in the morphology at all. . . The value of the typology qua
       typology is thus very much in doubt."
    c. Spencer (1991: 38) "This typology, though sanctioned by tradition, has been
       criticized for being both incoherent and useless. It is useless because nothing
       of any interest follows from classifying languages in this way."
But if classical morphological typology is "incoherent and useless", why is the ter-
minology still with us? Moreover, most linguists find that the parameters of degree
of synthesis (e.g. Greenberg 1954[1960], Bickel & Nichols 2005) and incorporation
(e.g. Baker 1996) are of great typological interest. Is there also an "agglutination
parameter"? In the following section I will argue that the agglutination/fusion dis-
tinction is much more interesting than superficial textbook statements such as in
(2a-c) make it appear, but we will eventually see that an empirical test largely comes
to negative conclusions about ist validity.


2 The Agglutination Hypothesis: Implicit Claims Made Explicit

Anderson, Bauer and Spencer make seriously misleading statements when they
claim that nothing of interest follows from classifying languages into agglutinating
and fusional types, and that it implies no correlations. The use of this classification
does imply testable claims about extremely interesting correlations, but these claims
are usually not made explicit.
    The reason why the classification implies a number of correlations is that "ag-
glutinating language" is not a primitive notion. As we will see shortly, saying
that a language or a pattern is agglutinating embodies a set of logically separate
claims. By accepting the classification of languages or patterns into agglutinating
and non-agglutinating types, one implicitly accepts the idea that the various proper-
ties that make a language agglutinating correlate with each other. Thus, we should
think of agglutination not so much as a classificatory concept or as a parameter
16                                                                                  M. Haspelmath

of variation, but as an empirically testable hypothesis. I call it the Agglutination
Hypothesis here, and I distinguish two main components of it. (This is very similar
to Plank's (1999:285) "Strong Homogeneity Hypothesis".3 )
    The first empirical claim (or universal prediction) follows from the fact that what
is normally classified as agglutinating or fusional is whole languages, not just small
subsystems. So implicit in this classification is the expectation that the First Predic-
tion in (3) is correct.
(3) First Prediction: Correlation among parts of the morphology
    If a language is agglutinating/fusional in one area of its morphology (e.g. in
    nouns, or in the future tense), it tends to show the same type elsewhere.
Logically speaking, languages could of course be agglutinating in their noun mor-
phology and fusional in their verb morphology, or even isolating in the indicative
mood and agglutinating in the subjunctive mood. But linguists tend to accept the no-
tion that the morphological types apply to entire languages, thus implicitly claiming
that languages are more homogeneous than they would have to be. This presup-
position of course goes back to the early 19th century, and it could be that it is
simply naive. In the early days of modern typology, what struck linguists was the
differences between languages, and not so much the more abstract differences be-
tween patterns. In other areas of typology, linguists also tended to ascribe interesting
differences to languages in the past (e.g. "ergative languages", "tone languages"),
whereas more recently they have usually become more careful, recognizing that
system splits (such as ergative in the perfective vs. accusative in the imperfective)
are not a marginal phenomenon. Dividing languages into accusative, ergative and
neutral languages is a meaningful enterprise only if one expects that different con-
structions tend to show the same patterns, or at least that one of the constructions is
somehow predominant.
    The second empirical claim follows from the fact that agglutination is not a prim-
itive feature. But what exactly are the component features of agglutination? Unfor-
tunately, it is very difficult to find a precise definition of agglutination and fusion in
the literature. A few exemplary definitions are listed in (4) (emphasis is mine).
(4) a. Bloomfield (1933: 207): "Inflectional languages show a merging of seman-
       tically distinct features either in a single bound form or in closely united
       bound forms, as when the suffix -ō in a Latin form like am ō 'I love' ex-
       presses the meanings 1st, sg, pres, ind."
    b. Hjelmslev (1963[1968:109]): ". . . flektierenden Typ, bei dem die Grenze
       zwischen Wurzel und Suffix nicht klar ist, bei dem jedes Suffix oftmals
       gleichzeitig mehrere verschiedene grammatische Verhältnisse ausdrückt, und



3 The only reason I do not adopt Plank's term is that my term "Agglutination Hypothesis" appears
in the title of this paper, and I did not want the paper to be unrecognizable. Note that I developed
these ideas independently of Plank (but under the influence of his earlier work, e.g. Plank 1986,
1991), at about the same time.
An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                                   17

        bei dem die Wurzel selbst bei der Flexion Veränderungen erfahren
        kann."4
     c. Anderson (1985: 9): "(in)flectional languages have internally complex words
        which cannot easily be segmented into an exhaustive and non-overlapping
        string of formatives"
     d. Vance (1987: 175): "[In agglutinative languages] each morph represents
        only one semantic unit. . . The other property is that morphs are simply
        stuck together ("agglutinated"); ideally, the boundaries between morphs
        are clear, and there is no allomorphy."
     e. Whaley (1997: 134): "A language is fusional if the boundaries between its
        morphemes are hard to determine. The effect is as if the morphemes were
        blending, or fusing, together."
    Most modern authors seem to agree that one of the ingredients of fusion is cu-
mulation, i.e. the expression of several morphological subcategories in one affix (cf.
the quotations from Bloomfield, Hjelmslev and Vance).5 Agglutinating structures,
by contrast, exhibit separation (to use a terminology that was introduced by Frans
Plank, cf. Plank 1986, 1999).
    Another characteristic of fusional languages is that they exhibit stem alterna-
tions, i.e. the (co-)expression of morphological categories by changing, rather than
adding to, the stem (cf. Hjelmslev's definition). This is actually the oldest criterion:
Friedrich von Schlegel and his 19th century followers were primarily struck by the
difference between, on the one hand, languages like Sanskrit and German with their
salient stem vowel changes, and on the other hand, languages like Quechua, which
exhibit complete stem invariance.
    A very vague criterion that is often mentioned in definitions of fusion and aggluti-
nation is that segmentation of morphemes is "difficult" (cf. Hjelmslev's, Anderson's
and Whaley's definitions). The question of course is what properties of the language
cause these difficulties. It seems that they often arise from stem alternations (see
the last paragraph) or from affix alternations. The basic idea is that in a typical
agglutinating language, each affix not only stands for just one subcategory, but is
also invariant in its shape, whereas in fusional languages, not only stems, but also
affixes show considerable morphophonological allomorphy.6 Consider the partial
paradigm of Hungarian noun inflection in (5).



4 "the inflectional type, in which the boundary between root and suffix is not clear, in which each
suffix often expresses several different grammatical properties simultaneously, and in which the
root can undergo changes even in inflection."
5 Note that I use the term subcategory for concepts such as singular, dative, future, and category-
system for concepts like number, case, tense. (Plank 1999 uses the terms term/category in the same
sense.)
6 Greenberg (1954[1960:185]) uses morphophonological alternations of stems and affixes as the
decisive criterion for his "index of agglutination", i.e. he disregards cumulation, and he lumps stem
alternations and affix alternations together. (In this he is followed by other linguists working in the
tradition of quantitative typology, such as Krupa 1965 and Silnitsky 1993.)

                         Acc        házakat       asztalokat       folyókat
It is not immediately obvious how these forms should be segmented. For example,
in the accusative singular form házat, the accusative suffix could be taken as -at, or
as -t (as in asztal-t and folyó-t). In either case, we have to recognize an alternation, a
stem alternation (ház/háza) or an affix alternation (t/at). Thus, it is the existance of
alternations that makes segmentation difficult, and affix invariance makes it easy.
    An even more radical kind of lack of one-to-one correspondence between mean-
ing and form is affix suppletion, which is also commonly associated with fusional
as opposed to agglutinating morphology (see especially Skalička 1951). Affix sup-
pletion is allomorphy that cannot be described in phonological or morphophonolog-
ical terms. It can be conditioned lexically, as in (6a); morphologically, as in (6b); or
phonologically, as in (6c). Lack of affix suppletion will be called affix uniformity.

   It appears that cumulation, stem alternation, affix alternation, and affix sup-
pletion are the key ingredients of non-agglutination or fusion. In the following,
I will assume (somewhat counterfactually7 ) that no other morphological properties
are relevant to defining the agglutination/fusion distinction.

7 In a few works that address the agglutination/fusion distinction in some detail (Skalička 1951,
Pöchtrager et al. 1998, Plank 1999, Plungian 2001), a number of further correlating properties have
been mentioned:
   agglutinating                 fusional
   affixes distinct              affixes often homonymous
   always zero exponence         no/sporadic zero exponence
   only local exponence          also extended exponence
   repeatable affixes            unrepeatable affixes
   large paradigm size           small paradigm size (cf. Plank 1986)
   loose bonding                 tight bonding
   optionality                   obligatoriness
Thus, the number of claimed correlations that can be found in the literature is actually much higher.
However, since these correlations are little known, one would not say that using the terms "agglu-
tination" and "fusion" implies accepting these correlations as valid. Thus, testing these further
correlations is less urgent than testing the correlations that are implicit in the definitions of "agglu-
tination" and "fusion", and I will not say anything further about them here.
An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                                  19

   From the perspective of the individual properties, one could simply describe
a language as cumulating, or as stem-alternating, or as affix-uniform, and so on.
However, the fact that languages (or patterns) are typically described as "agglu-
tinating" or as "fusional" shows that linguists expect the component properties
to correlate with each other. So the Agglutination Hypothesis makes a second
prediction:

(7) Second Prediction: Correlation among different component properties
    If a language is agglutinating/fusional with respect to one of the component
    properties (cumulation, (stem/affix) alternation, affix suppletion), it will to be-
    have similarly with respect to the other features.
   Taken together, the two predictions made by the Agglutination Hypothesis are of
course extremely interesting for the comparative linguist. But whether the terms "ag-
glutination" and "fusion" are really useful depends also on whether the hypothesis is
true. Somewhat surprisingly, this question has rarely been asked (Plank 1999, which
came to my attention only after the first version of this paper had been finished, is
the only exception known to me).
   Apparently, it has not been generally recognized that the terms "agglutination"
and "fusion" imply strong empirical claims, so linguists have not attempted to test
these empirical claims. Another reason why such a test has not been carried out is
probably that it encounters multiple difficulties, some of which will be addressed
in the next section. However, I will also say how they can be overcome, so that in
Section 4 I will present a first empirical test of the correlations.



3 Difficulties for an Empirical Test

If one wants to compare the morphological systems of widely different languages,
one needs to make a large number of simplifications and idealizations, hoping that
these do not introduce a bias into the investigation. In this section I discuss some of
the difficulties I encountered in testing the two predictions of the preceding section,
and make proposals for how to overcome them.
    First, different languages show different morphological categories and vary sig-
nificantly in morphological complexity. This is a difficulty especially for testing the
First Prediction. For example, if this prediction is taken to imply that agglutinaton
in nouns entails agglutination in verbs, it is impossible to test in languages that have
inflectional morphology in verbs but not in nouns.8 To address this difficulty, I only
looked at languages with a fair amount of inflection, and took into account only
the core of nominal and verbal inflection. Thus, I left aside inflection of adjectives,
adpositions and other word classes (which are difficult to compare across languages


8   Such languages could of course be taken to exhibit isolation in nouns, though this is rarely done.
20                                                                         M. Haspelmath

anyway). I also left aside non-finite verb morphology, which does not belong to the
core of verbal inflection and differs more across languages than tense, aspect and
voice morphology. The assumption behind this is that if the idea at the heart of the
Agglutination Hypothesis is correct, the correlations should emerge even if only the
core inflectional categories of nouns and verbs are considered.
   Second, it is well-known that cumulation is extremely common everywhere
with person-number affixes (cf. Cysouw 2003: 296). Some examples of possessive
person-number affixes in languages from different continents are given in (8):

(8)        Hungarian           O'odham           Tauya             Lango
           (Uralic;            (Uto-Aztecan;     (Trans- New       (Nilotic;
           Europe)             North             Guinea)           Africa)

                                                                       e
   3       kez-e               kakkio-j          Ø-neme            pàlà-mέrε̂
Pl 1       kez-ünk            t-kakkio          se-neme           pàlà-wá
   2       kez-etek            'em-kakkio        te-neme           pàl` -wú
                                                                       e
   3       kez-ük             ha-kakkio         ne-neme           pàlà-gı́
           'my hand etc.'      'my legs etc.'    'my head etc.'    'my knife etc.'
Thus, including person-number affixes would lead us to find some amount of cu-
mulation in the great majority of languages, even in languages that otherwise would
probably be regarded as perfect examples of the agglutinating type. Thus, in my
empirical test, I counted "person-number(-gender)" as a single inflectional category-
system, so that these cases do not count as cumulation.
    Third, in tense-aspect-mood forms, cumulation also seems to be common, but it
is extremely difficult to identify the categories that are cumulated and to distinguish
cumulation from semantic complexity. Consider the examples in (9).

(9)                         past + perfective   past + imperfective
      a. Modern Greek       é-γ rap-s-e        é-γ raf-Ø-e               's/he wrote'
      b. Lezgian            qaču-na            qaču-zwa-j                'took'
      c. Italian            port-ai             port-avo                   'I carried'
      d. Pipil              chiw-ki             chiwa-ya                   'did'

In Modern Greek, one can readily isolate a perfective marker −s and a past marker
é-. Both forms are fully compositional. In Lezgian (Haspelmath 1993), it is pos-
sible to identify an imperfective marker -zwa and a past marker − j, but the past
perfective -na is not compositional. In Italian and Pipil (a Uto-Aztecan language
of El Salvador), we have no compositionality at all. We might say that both Ital-
ian and Pipil are fully cumulative, but it is not even fully clear that "past" and
"(im)perfective" are separate inflectional categories in these languages. To avoid
these complications, I regarded "tense-aspect-mood" as a single category-system,
unless there were very strong reasons to separate them.
An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                               21

   Fourth, a problem with measuring the relevance of stem alternations is that
in most languages, only a subset of lexical items show stem alternations (e.g. in
German, only strong verbs alternate, and these are a small minority), and gener-
ally most lexical items do not alternate. We would probably want to quantify the
importance of stem alternation: A language that has a stem change in one lexical
item should not be regarded as equally fusional (with regard to the criterion of stem
alternation) as a language that has stem changes in more than a hundred items. Thus,
for each category-system separately, I assigned scores depending on the (estimated)
absolute number of lexemes that exhibit stem alternations:
   score of 1       fewer than 10 lexemes with stem alternation
   score of 4       10-50 lexemes
   score of 7       more than 50 lexemes
   score of 10 the majority of (or all) lexemes
   Fifth, morphophonological affix alternations are very difficult to distinguish from
purely phonologically conditioned alternations. For example, the German plural
suffix -n/-en (as in Straße-n 'streets', Frau-en 'women' Partikel-n 'particles') could
either be described as morphophonological affix alternations (making German fu-
sional in this regard), or as the same affix that happens to have different realizations
for purely phonological reasons. After considering this problem thoroughly, I de-
cided to exclude the property "affix alternation" from the empirical test, because it
did not seem feasible to make the distinction in a coherent way for a greater number
of languages.9


4 The Empirical Test

4.1 Data
Thus, in my empirical test of the two predictions I studied three properties of
morphological systems: cumulation, stem alternation, and affix suppletion. I ex-
amined a sample of thirty languages which is somewhat biased in the usual way,
with more languages from Europe than would be justified by the genealogical di-
versity in Europe. Not all the languages are unrelated, but each is from a differ-
ent genus (in the sense of Dryer 2005). The thirty sample languages are listed in
Table 1.
   For each of these thirty languages, I determined a Cumulation Index, an Alter-
nation Index, and a Suppletion Index, separately for nominal and for verbal inflec-
tion. The value of these indices is always between 0 (maximal agglutination) and
100 (maximal fusion). The Cumulation Index is defined as the percentage of in-
flected forms that exhibit cumulation; the Alternation Index is defined as the average

9 I also simplified the procedure by considering only up to fifteen subcategories per lexeme class,
and only up to ten subcategories per category-system, on the assumption that more was not required
to capture the type of the language.

alternation score (cf. Section 3), i.e. the sum of stem alternation scores for each
category-system divided by the number of category-systems; and the Suppletion
Index is defined as the average percentage of subcategories (per category-system)
that exhibit affix suppletion.



4.2 Testing the Second Prediction: Correlation Among
    the Three Indices?

Let us begin by examining the Second Prediction: is there a correlation among the
three indices? Do languages with a lot of stem changes also show a lot of cumula-
tion, and do languages with a lot of cumulation also show a lot of affix suppletion?
The values of the three indices for the sample languages are shown in Table 2, where
the languages are listed in rank order.
    Comparison between the three indices is made difficult by the fact that the num-
bers stand for very different things. The total range of the values is not very different:
between 0 and 66 for Cumulation, between 0 and 75 for Alternation, and between
0 and 84 for Suppletion. Thus, no language shows 100% fusion with respect to
any of the indices, and for each index, there is at least one language with 100%
agglutination. However, it is easily seen that the Cumulation values tend to be much
lower than the Alternation and Suppletion values. Cumulation is simply a rare phe-
nomenon outside of the Indo-European family, if cumulation of person and number
is disregarded and if tense and aspect are not counted separately (see the discussion
in Section 3). Only the Indo-European languages Hindi-Urdu and Latin have figures
over 20% of cumulative forms.

   Now the crucial question is: Do the languages tend to exhibit similar values for
each of the three indices?10 This is difficult to see by just inspecting Table 2, so in
order to make the indices more comparable, I compared the rank values on the three
indices. Table 3 lists languages in the order of average rank. The first three columns
give the three indices, but the most important triple of figures is the rank values in

10 That the different components of agglutination do not always go together has occasionally been
noted in the literature. Thus, Vance (1987: 176) notes for Japanese:
   "Japanese morphology certainly tends to be agglutinative. The two properties involved in
   agglutination, however, do not correlate very well. Portmanteau morphs are rare. . . Allo-
   morphy, on the other hand, is not at all uncommon. . ."

the next three columns. These figures show, for example, that Tauya has rank 14 for
Cumulation, rank 4 for Alternation, and rank 2 for Suppletion, and so on. By the
criterion of average rank, Tauya turns out to be the "most agglutinating" language,
while Kannada is the "least agglutinating" language, and Indo-European languages
such as Latin and German are also close to the bottom. This accords well with
our expectations, of course, but there are also some surprises, especially perhaps
the low (and hence "relatively fusional") position of Hungarian and Finnish. These
languages have traditionally been labelled "agglutinating" (in Table 3, all languages
which have been called "agglutinating" in the literature are preceded by an asterisk).
    Of course, the confirmation of our expectations for Turkish and Latin does
not mean that the Agglutination Hypothesis has been confirmed. On the contrary,
it could well be that the models of these two well-known languages have been
so powerful that linguists have unconsciously tended to define agglutinating as

"Turkish-like" and fusional as "Latin-like".11 In this way, various properties that
happen to be combined in these languages would have become part of the typolog-
ical prototype, although there is in fact no tendency for these features to cooccur in
languages cross-linguistically.
   As can be seen from Table 3, there are some "well-behaved" languages that show
similar rankings with respect to the three indices, e.g. Maricopa (ranks 13, 14, 12),
Ossetic (ranks 21, 21, 24.5), Arabic (ranks 23, 25, 27), and Kannada (ranks 25,
26, 24.5). If all languages were like these, we would say that the three indices
really cluster with each other, and that the Second Prediction of the Agglutinaton
Hypothesis has been confirmed.
   But unfortunately, too many languages are not "well-behaved". For example,
Nivkh has the ranks 22, 4, 1, Páez has the ranks 28, 4, 5, Ponapean has the ranks
5.5, 30, 3, and Hindi-Urdu has the ranks 29, 4, 23. In fact, there is no statistically
significant correlation among the three rankings: the Kendall coefficient of concor-
dance is W = 0.37, X2 = 32.19, and the significance is p < .35, well above the
significance level of .05. My empirical test thus provides no support for the Second
Prediction of the Agglutination Hypothesis.
   This does not mean, of course, that I have definitively disconfirmed this predic-
tion. My assignment of the various indices has involved some simplifications and
arbitrary choices that could have influenced the results in a negative way. But my
results present a strong challenge to those linguists who still want to maintain the
agglutination-fusion distinction.


4.3 Testing the First Prediction: Correlation Among Nominal
    and Verbal Inflection?

But what about the First Prediction, concerning the correlation between different
parts of the morphology? Since it is well-known that verbs and nouns sometimes be-
have differently (e.g. the Romance and Balkan Slavic languages lost their nomonal
case inflection, but retained the synthetic verb inflection of their ancestors), one
might not have particularly high expectations with regard to this prediction. Already
Greenberg (1954[1960: 182]) noted that "a term like agglutinative applies primarily
to a single construction. A language may well and indeed usually does contain some
agglutinational as well as some nonagglutinational constructions." And Wolfgang
U. Dressler, a consistent proponent of the agglutination-inflection typology along
Skalicka's lines (cf. Dressler 1985, Pöchtrager et al. 1998), has recently acknowl-
edged that "noun inflection and verb inflection may have a different typological
character within the same language and develop diachronically in typologically
different directions" (Dressler 2005: 7). Thus, it is not exactly expected that the
First Prediction would fare better in my empirical test.


11 A quotation such as the following is quite typical: "The ideal type of an agglutinating language,
best represented in Turkish. . ." (Pöchtrager et al. 1998: 57).
26                                                                               M. Haspelmath

   To test it, I looked at nouns and verbs separately, for all three indices. Table 4
shows the index values and rank numbers, separately for the three indices.
   We see that for Alternation and especially Suppletion, the rankings do corre-
late significantly (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, p < 0.01 (Suppletion),
p < 0.05 (Alternation)). However, for Cumulation there is no significant correlation
(p < 0.20).
   Thus, we can say that languages tend to show (or lack) affix suppletion and stem
alternations in both nouns and verbs simultaneously. In other words, languages
can be meaningfully typologized as generally affix-suppleting (vs. affix-invariant)
languages, and as generally stem-alternating (vs. stem-uniform) languages, at least
across nouns and verbs. Thus, it is not completely meaningless to search for the
kinds of correlations that we have been looking at here. But these positive correla-
tions are hardly sufficient to justify a global distinction between "agglutinating" and

An Empirical Test of the Agglutination Hypothesis                                     27

"fusional" languages, because as we saw in the preceding section, affix suppletion
and stem alternation do not correlate among each other.


5 Conclusions
The overall results of this study are mostly negative. The main positive point is that
it is indeed possible, if difficult, to test the Agglutination Hypothesis empirically.
    But the result of the preliminary empirical test carried out here is mostly negative.
I have not found a statistically significant correlation between the Cumulation index,
the Alternation index and the Suppletion index, which would have been expected
if the correlations implicit in the composite types "agglutinating" and "fusional"
existed.
    Also, the evidence that nouns and verbs tend to behave alike is not overwhelming.
There is no correlation with respect to cumulation, which is sometimes taken to be
the primary defining property of "fusional" languages (especially in the more recent
literature), and also for alternation, the evidence for a correlation is not particularly
strong. However, with respect to affix suppletion, we can say that nouns and verbs
tend to behave in the same way across languages.
    Since the study is based on a relatively small number of languages and the sample
is not truly representative of the diversity of the world's languages, these results are
far from conclusive. I cannot say that I have shown that the Agglutination Hypothe-
sis is wrong. However, the results cast sufficient doubt on the hypothesis to say that
from now on, the burden of proof is on those who believe that it is correct.
    As there are indications that stem alternation and affix suppletion characterize
both nouns and verbs, one can legitimately characterize entire languages as affix-
suppleting or stem-alternating. However, since cumulation does not tend to be sim-
ilar across word classes, it is less meaningful to characterize entire languages as
"cumulating" or "separatist". These terms are meaningful primarily when applied
to particular morphological subsystems.
    After this study, the terms agglutination and fusion have lost much of their legit-
imacy (unless they are given a technical sense that is at variance with the common
usage). Of course, it is logically possible to define a composite type consisting of
properties that do not correlate with each other (or only very partially), but it does
not make much sense. While Turkish could perhaps still be characterized as "agglu-
tinating" and Latin as "fusional", for many languages neither of these terms would
apply, and it would not be possible to say that they are "intermediate" between
these two extremes either. It is quite possible that the reason for the success of the
agglutination/fusion distinction is that Latin and Turkish have been such promi-
nent languages in Western linguistics over the last few hundred years. They differ
strikingly in their morphological systems (cf. Plank 1991), and it is perhaps natural
that from this point of view one would classify languages as more Latin-like or
more Turkish-like. However, linguistics should move beyond Lationocentrism and
Turkocentrism and try to do justice to each language, to describe and characterize it
in its own terms, or in truly universal terms.
